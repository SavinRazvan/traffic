### Traffic Sign Classification with TensorFlow

This project is part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. The objective is to create a neural network capable of classifying traffic signs from images using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

#### Features:
1. **Data Preparation**: Images are preprocessed using OpenCV.
2. **Model Development**: A TensorFlow-based neural network is built and trained.
3. **Evaluation**: Model performance is validated on a test dataset.
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the experimentation process.

#### Dataset
For using the GTSRB dataset, you can download the datasets from the following CDN links:
- [GTSRB - Training and Testing Dataset](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip)
- [GTSRB Small - Training and Testing Dataset](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2023/x/projects/5/gtsrb-small.zip)
