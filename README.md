### Traffic Sign Classification with TensorFlow

This project is part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. The objective is to create a neural network capable of classifying traffic signs from images using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

#### Features
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Images are preprocessed using OpenCV.
   - Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training data.

2. **Model Development**: 
   - A TensorFlow-based neural network is built and trained.
   - Model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Evaluation**: 
   - Model performance is validated on a test dataset.
   - The model is used to make predictions on unseen data.

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Detailed documentation of the experimentation process is provided.
